#Music Zen 

## Overview 

Project for implementing ML model that makes music from input audio files. 

## Procedure 

1. GET DATA 

### install pytube 

install pytube using 

`python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube` 
as directly isntalling from pip would give give 'StreamingData' errors 

### use pytube 

Youtube using DASH - Dynbamic Adaptive Stream through HTTPS

when querying a url we receive list of streams avaialble 
we would chose audio streams prefereably 
download sample from collected sources and store them
these sample audio file is going to be the training data testing data for our ML model . 

### clean data 

no need to clean data as audio files are just music 

2. CHOSE MODEL 

3. TRAIN MODEL 

4. RUN MODEL 

5. ITERATE
